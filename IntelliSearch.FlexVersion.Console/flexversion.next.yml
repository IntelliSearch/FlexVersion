# The configuration file si in YAML format: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
# It is suggested to learn the basics of YAML to be more confident on changing this file.
# In addition to the more intuitive format of the file, it uses 'anchors' to reference 
# values used elsewhere (defined with &VAR_NAME, and used with *VAR_NAME or <<: *VAR_NAME)

# Configures how all branches are to behave.
Branches:

    # Default branch-definition, to be used by any branch that does not have their own definition and as a default for all other branches
    # Note: Using YAML backreference to define a default that is reused for later branches.
